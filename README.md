## General FAQ
### What is Subnautica 2.0?
An update to the game which caused QModManager to break, and also brought along a ton of changes to the game code. Both of these have caused the need for most (if not all) mods to update to be compatible with the latest version of the game. 

### What is Subnautica Legacy?
A branch of the game available to Steam users. It is the game version prior to the current build, which is 71137, and the Legacy build is 68598.
Keep in mind, as this is the previous version of the game, all mods that worked before the update, will work on Legacy.
You can find instructions to access the Legacy branch [here]().

## Mod Setup for SN (Subnautica) 2.0
 1. Download the [Subnautica BepInEx Pack](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnautica/mods/1108), and optionally, but recommended, [BepInEx Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnautica/mods/1104?tab=description), and [Configuration Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnautica/mods/1112).
 
 2. If you have used `QModManager` before or have any existing mod installations, delete the `QMods` & `BepInEx` folders from your game folder. <strong>Backup your QMods folder if you believe you might switch to [Subnautica Legacy]() at some point in the future.</strong>
 
 3. Extract / Unzip the `Subnautica BepInEx Pack` zip file into your game installation folder. <strong>If it asks about replacing / overwriting files, select Yes, or confirm, or something of that equivalent.</strong>
 
 4. Launch the game to generate a `plugins` folder, which will appear inside the `BepInEx` folder located in your game installation folder.
 
 5. If installed, extract the `BepInEx Tweaks` & `Configuration Manager` zip files into your <strong>game folder</strong>, and they *should* end up inside the `BepInEx\plugins` folder. 
 
 6. You are now free to install mods that are updated for 2.0, [see the list here](https://ramuneneptune.github.io/modlists/sn.html).
